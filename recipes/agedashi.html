        <p>It all started when I was seven.</p>
        <p>No, just kidding. Tofu agedashi is a super simple meal that happens to be very cheap. A single block of tofu and some flour is all that's needed for the base. Then drizzle some miso sauce on it and garnish.</p>

            <li>4 Tbsp flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp grated ginger, and red radish slices for garnish</li>
            <li>1 Spring onion, finely sliced diagnolly to garnish</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp barley miso, mixed with water to a sauce-like consistency</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
